# 📜 Legal & Ethical Framework - Digital World Congress

## 🌍 **Core Principles**
The **Digital World Congress (DWC)** is founded on the following principles:
- **Democratic Representation** – All global citizens have a voice.
- **Rule of Law** – Decisions align with international human rights.
- **Transparency** – All votes and policies are verifiable.
- **Decentralization** – No single entity controls governance.

## 📜 **1. Legal Status & Recognition**
- The DWC will function as an **independent, decentralized governance entity**.
- Member states must **ratify participation** through national votes or treaties.
- **Hybrid Model**: Starts as a **decentralized advisory body (DAO)** and evolves into an **Intergovernmental Organization (IGO)**.

## 📜 **2. Membership & Representation**
- **Nations, regional unions, and indigenous groups** may apply for representation.
- **Two-Chamber Structure:**
  - **People’s Assembly** (Direct Democracy) → Every citizen can vote on policies.
  - **State Assembly** (Nation-Based) → Elected representatives for each country.

## 📜 **3. Voting & Lawmaking Procedures**
1. **Policy Proposal** → Citizens and organizations submit proposals.
2. **AI & Legal Review** → Ensures proposals align with human rights & sustainability.
3. **Public Debate** → Open discussion before voting.
4. **Secure Blockchain Voting** → Verified identity, tamper-proof voting.
5. **Smart Contract Execution** → Approved policies are enforced automatically.

## 📜 **4. Human Rights & Privacy Protections**
- **No laws may violate fundamental human rights** (free speech, privacy, economic rights).
- **AI Moderation is transparent** → No political bias or manipulation.
- **Privacy Protection** → Uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** and **Decentralized Identity (DID)**.

## 📜 **5. Enforcement & Compliance**
- **Decentralized global courts** resolve disputes.
- **Non-compliant nations face economic restrictions**, not military action.
- **AI-powered conflict prediction** prevents wars.

## 📜 **6. Economic & Trade Policies**
- **No unilateral tariffs** → Trade laws must be democratically voted on.
- **Universal tax framework** prevents corporate exploitation.
- **Smart Contracts** manage global trade agreements.

## 📜 **7. Climate & Sustainability Policies**
- **Universal Environmental Laws** → Prevent deforestation, reduce carbon emissions.
- **Climate Justice Fund** → Helps developing nations transition to green economies.

## 📜 **8. Ethical AI & Digital Rights**
- **AI cannot be used for mass surveillance or censorship**.
- **AI Moderation ensures fair governance discussions**.
- **Free Speech & Privacy are protected** under decentralized rules.
